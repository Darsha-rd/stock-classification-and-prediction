developed a real-time stock classification and prediction application using MLP, SimpleRNN, and LSTM deep learning models and Streamlit User interface.

Key highlights of our project:
✅Real-time stock data collection from Yahoo Finance
✅Classification (price movement) and regression (price prediction) models
✅Visualizations, model comparisons, and a working demo included
✅LSTM achieved the best performance with 60% accuracy in classification and the lowest RMSE in regression.
✅Built with Streamlit for interactive UI 
✅In the UI it can select a ticker from a drop list. And it can select the model (MLP, LSTM, SimpleRNN) from a drop list.
